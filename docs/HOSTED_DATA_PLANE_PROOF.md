# FR-007 hosted data-plane proof

This is the repository-owned bridge from disposable PostgreSQL proof to a real
hosted staging PostgreSQL/Supabase data plane. It wraps the existing
`production_db_preflight.py` and `migration_acceptance.py` contracts; it does
not create a second migration engine or claim production completion.

## Secret contract

Inject these names at runtime only:

* `OPOS_SOURCE_DB_URL`
* `OPOS_TARGET_DB_URL`

Values are never printed or written to evidence. The report contains only
short configured/live identity fingerprints and sanitized host names. The
source and target must be different databases, verified by read-only live
PostgreSQL facts before a write-capable run. Hosted mode rejects loopback
targets.

Use a Supabase **direct/session-capable database endpoint** for migration.
Transaction or session pooler endpoints are not accepted for
`MIGRATE_STAGING`; a provider's control plane still has to confirm the
endpoint topology. TLS is required (`sslmode=require`, `verify-ca`, or
`verify-full`). The existing read-only preflight checks PostgreSQL version,
TLS, privileges, schema ownership, Alembic state, target emptiness, session
settings, timeouts, and database size where available.

## Local invocation

```bash
python scripts/hosted_data_plane_proof.py \
  --mode PRECHECK --connection-mode direct \
  --output-dir /secure/fr007-run \
  --evidence /secure/fr007-run/hosted-proof.json
```

After reviewing the preflight and pausing source writes with the deployment
owner, the explicitly authorized staging run is:

```bash
python scripts/hosted_data_plane_proof.py \
  --mode MIGRATE_STAGING --connection-mode direct \
  --acknowledge-staging-migration \
  --acknowledge-source-writes-paused \
  --acknowledge-target-writes-disabled \
  --output-dir /secure/fr007-run \
  --evidence /secure/fr007-run/hosted-proof.json
```

`VERIFY_STAGING` performs a new read-only live revision and baseline/parity
check against source and target. It does not depend on a prior runner's
filesystem and performs no writes. Every dependent stage stops on a blocked or
failed precondition. There is no automatic cutover or DNS/API/frontend change.

## GitHub Actions

Run **FR-007 hosted data-plane proof** through `workflow_dispatch`, selecting
`PRECHECK`, `MIGRATE_STAGING`, or `VERIFY_STAGING`. The job uses the protected
`fr007-staging` environment and the two secret names above. It has no
push/PR trigger, so ordinary CI cannot run a destructive mode. The uploaded
`report.json` is sanitized operational evidence.

## Evidence and acceptance boundary

The report distinguishes `PRECHECK`, `MIGRATE`, `VERIFY`, and
`CUTOVER_READY`, with `PASS`, `PARTIAL`, `NOT_RUN`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAIL` states.
`CUTOVER_READY` is only a partial readiness signal; this packet never performs
traffic cutover. A real source-to-hosted-target run with credentials is needed
for FR-007 A-9 evidence. Unit tests, disposable PostgreSQL, or a PRECHECK do
not close A-9 and do not prove Supabase migration. Evidence contains no DSN,
redacted or otherwise; only allowlisted fingerprints and operational facts are
written.

If verification fails, keep the source authoritative, isolate the target, and
retry only with a new empty target after checking the backup manifest. Any
post-cutover rollback and traffic routing remain deployment-owner actions.
