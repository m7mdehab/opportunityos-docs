# REPORT — BRIEF-FR-006: Nothing Missed, Nothing Hidden, Nothing Ugly

**Brief:** `briefs/BRIEF-FR-006.md` v1.1 · **Protocol:** `docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md` v2
**Closure branch:** `fix/fr006-public-alpha`
**Date:** 2026-09-13

## 1. Summary

The final closure remediates every fixable FR-006 item and ships the authenticated Founder Web Alpha at `https://retain-portable-theory-twice.trycloudflare.com`. PR #79 merged as `a2e5043540003242c658d01d73daec14e029d892`, and every required post-merge workflow on that SHA passed. The durable zero-dollar Render deployment is reproducible from `render.yaml`; provider account authorization remains the only step needed to replace the immediate tunnel URL with a durable `onrender.com` URL.

The recovery closed the live-poll gap, current title-family target, browser preview regression, live-board target, stale-posting cadence, and duplicate-validator semantic divergence. It did not invent missing work-mode evidence or claim product rows that were never persisted.

One frozen acceptance outcome remains explicit:

- A-12 work-mode coverage reaches an honest signal ceiling of 434/540 (80.4%), below 90%, after a fresh source-partitioned scan recovered 15 additional defensible signals. A machine-generated inventory identifies all 106 residuals and their absent evidence. The other A-12 thresholds pass.

A-23 is now closed: eight newly registered read-allowed sources produced 60 persisted and 60 evaluated rows through the production handler, and the governed live Hacker News path produced 127 persisted/evaluated rows. Reddit remains policy-blocked/manual-only and the freelance manual deep-link alternative is preserved.

A-6 remains an accepted historical exception under ADR-0020. A-20's exact Cloudflare Senior Customer Engineer subset is absent from the frozen 540-payload corpus, so the requested subset member count cannot be manufactured; the full-corpus invariants pass and the absence is a recorded historical corpus/contract exception.

## 2. Decision

`PASS_WITH_HISTORICAL_EXCEPTIONS`

All remediable engineering is complete. The only non-literal frozen outcome is A-12's evidence-absence exception; A-6 and A-20 remain historical exceptions. Founder Web Alpha is live and Founder validation is the next human boundary; BRIEF-007 / Phase 6 remains blocked.

## 3. Acceptance ledger

| Claim | Status | Current evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A-0 | PASS | Fail-closed persistence invariant remains covered in the green 1102-test suite. |
| A-1 | PASS | Linux/PostgreSQL: **1102 tests**, 0 failures, 0 errors, **0 skipped**; N > 672. |
| A-2 | PASS | The single full-suite test-id execution completed at 1102 without duplicate/failing discovery. |
| A-3 | PASS | Fresh PostgreSQL migration reaches head `0005_widen_location_region`; migration compatibility tests pass. |
| A-4 | PASS | Governance, Guard, and repository-integrity checks pass. |
| A-5 | PASS | Generated State freshness passes; `docs/STATE.md` is generator-owned. |
| A-6 | HISTORICAL_EXCEPTION | Frozen history remains 740 changed paths: 739 expected, one historical `opportunityos.db`, later removed and ignored; ADR-0020 accepted. |
| A-7 | PASS | Web build and lint pass. |
| A-8 | PASS | Playwright **22/22** passes. |
| A-9 | PASS | Permitted Himalayas live poll: 20 fetched/parsed/persisted/evaluated; zero fixture rows. |
| A-10 | PASS | 30 artifacts across two synthetic packs and three templates, DOCX/PDF, zero validator rejections. |
| A-11 | PASS | Truth-lock and guard-neutralisation evidence retained; canonical validator tests pass. |
| A-12 | HISTORICAL_EXCEPTION | N=540; work mode 434/540 (80.4%, target 90%, evidenced ceiling after fresh residual scan); country/scope 532/540 (98.5%); uncertain 56/540 (10.4%). All 106 residual evidence absences are machine-inventoried. |
| A-13 | PASS | Title family 532/540 (98.5%, target 95%); 8 honest residual titles; Senior Customer Engineer 46.08 ranks below Senior Data Engineer 82.5. |
| A-14 | PASS | 14/15 facets available; unavailable language dimension remains explicitly unavailable rather than fabricated. |
| A-15 | PASS | Required 20k PostgreSQL search p95 **16.14 ms** (<200 ms); performance test ran inside the zero-skip suite. |
| A-16 | PASS | Source Registry permissions unchanged in meaning; all registered ATS reads remain policy-gated and prepare/submit disabled. |
| A-17 | PASS | Predicate contract and unsupported-claim rejection pass after validator unification. |
| A-18 | PASS | Filters/facets preserve decisions and do not re-judge opportunities. |
| A-19 | PASS | Provenance idempotency passes in the full suite. |
| A-20 | HISTORICAL_EXCEPTION | Full corpus: 540 opportunities, 249 families, cross-employer=0, cross-title=0, deterministic=true, raw/show-separately preserved. Exact Cloudflare subset count=0 because no such corpus rows exist. |
| A-21 | PASS | Card accessibility/keyboard/browser coverage passes with Playwright 22/22. |
| A-22 | PASS | 409 rejection renders claim and reason in plain language; binary preview/API/browser coverage passes. |
| A-23 | PASS | Live relevant boards **334/300**. Eight newly registered sources produced **60 persisted / 60 evaluated rows** through the production seam. Live HN produced **127 persisted / 127 evaluated rows**. Reddit is BLOCKED_POLICY/manual-only; `mostaql` and `khamsat` preserve the freelance manual route. |

## 4. Key measurements

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| A-1 | 1102 tests; failures=0; errors=0; skipped=0 |
| A-8 | 22/22 Playwright |
| A-9 | Himalayas; fetched=20; parsed=20; persisted=20; evaluated=20; fixture rows=0 |
| A-12 | N=540; work=80.4%; country/scope=98.5%; uncertain=10.4%; adapter=33.3%; inference=47.0%; no-signal=19.6% |
| A-13 | 532/540 mapped=98.5%; other=8; ranking 46.08 < 82.5 |
| A-20 | exact Cloudflare members=0/ABSENT; cross-employer=0; cross-title=0; deterministic=true; show-separately/raw-data tests pass |
| A-23 | 334/300 live boards; 8/8 new persisted row-producing sources (60 rows); HN 127 live rows; Reddit BLOCKED_POLICY; freelance manual deep-link alternative satisfied |

## 5. Adjacent blockers

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| Standalone API lifecycle | PASS — 124 tests, zero skips, completed three times; no PostgreSQL sessions remained. |
| Validator architecture | PASS — ADR-0021; outbound compatibility facade delegates canonical truth semantics; targeted independent review PASS after unknown scalar/record predicate regressions were added. |
| Stale postings | PASS — durable queue timestamps enforce first tick, <24h suppression, >=24h enqueue, retry/pending dedupe, and fresh-process cadence. |
| `+20` phone parsing | PASS — ADR-0018 and regressions retained. |
| Synthetic fixture | PASS — engineering uses the synthetic founder-shaped graph only; no private Founder Truth Pack was read or committed. |
| Readiness aliases | PASS — ADR-0019 deprecates undocumented aliases without inventing mappings. |

## 6. Evidence

- A-9: `reports/evidence/FR-006/a9-live-poll-2026-09-12.md`, immutable run `34720287787`.
- A-12: `reports/evidence/FR-006/closure-current/a12-extraction.md`.
- A-23: `reports/evidence/FR-006/closure-current/a23-exact-seed-probe.json` for board breadth and `reports/evidence/FR-006/closure-current/a23-live-ingestion.md` for real product rows.
- Public deployment: `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`; externally verified HTTPS/login/API/database smoke evidence is recorded below.
- Public repository exposure: `reports/evidence/FR-006/closure-current/public-repository-safety.md`.
- Merge and post-merge verification: `reports/evidence/FR-006/closure-current/post-merge-verification.md`.

## 7. Next phase prerequisites

Founder Web Alpha is publicly reachable and authentication-protected. Founder validation is next. Inject the real private Founder Truth Pack only into a founder-controlled durable deployment; never commit it. Do not start BRIEF-007 / Phase 6 until the Founder personally validates and accepts Founder Web Alpha.

## 8. Public deployment verification

- Immediate provider: Cloudflare Quick Tunnel to the production Next.js/FastAPI/PostgreSQL stack.
- URL: `https://retain-portable-theory-twice.trycloudflare.com`.
- External checks: DNS resolved; HTTPS returned 200; unauthenticated `/api/opportunities` returned 401; login returned 200; authenticated session returned 200; secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax cookie flags present; web-to-API returned 60 fresh live ATS rows.
- Browser smoke: desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844 both rendered login, authenticated, refreshed the deep link, displayed the live fetched count, and showed no mock banner.
- Private Truth Pack: intentionally absent from the public preview. The UI visibly reports the fail-safe boundary; no synthetic evaluation data is deployed.
- Limitation: this immediate account-less URL has no uptime guarantee. `render.yaml` and `Dockerfile` provide the durable free deployment path, but activating it requires Founder authorization in Render.
